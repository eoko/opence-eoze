 * Fixes floatParent bug. In the original code, the date picker is assigned the picker field
 * as its ownerCt, but it shouldn't (no containing relationship). This incorrect behaviour,
 * coupled with another bug that prevents fieldsets from updating their collapsed state in
 * hierarchicalState, may causes the Date picker to be incorrectly considered hidden.
